<p>The TAG is a special group within the W3C, chartered under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#TAG">W3C Process Document</a>, with stewardship of the Web architecture. The mission of the TAG is to build consensus around principles of Web architecture and to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary, to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the TAG, and to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside W3C. The Members of the TAG participate as individual contributors, not as representatives of their organizations. TAG participants use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.

  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/png">PNG Working Group</a>
  has published a First Public Working Draft of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/">Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
  Specification (Third Edition)</a>.
  Completely backwards compatible with the millions of PNG graphics conforming to
  the older (2003) Second Edition, this new edition folds in reported errata and clarifications
  and also adds some much-requested new features:
</p>
<ul class="show_items">
<li><strong>Animated PNG</strong>, widely implemented for a decade but not part of the
    official specification until now</li>
<li><strong>Coding-Independent Code Points</strong>, which clearly identify the color space
    used by a graphic for improved rendering fidelity without blowing up the file size.
    This includes support for High Dynamic Range (HDR)
    color spaces such as BT.2100 HLG and PQ</li>
<li>Support for <strong>EXIF metadata</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  The PNG Working Group will continue to refine the PNG specification, including
   handling newly reported bugs,
  tracking implementations, and
  adding Web Platform Tests for the format.</p>
