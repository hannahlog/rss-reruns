			<![CDATA[<p>
  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/png">PNG Working Group</a>
  has published a First Public Working Draft of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-png-3-20221025/">Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
  Specification (Third Edition)</a>.
  Completely backwards compatible with the millions of PNG graphics conforming to
  the older (2003) Second Edition, this new edition folds in reported errata and clarifications
  and also adds some much-requested new features:
</p><ul class="show_items"><li><strong>Animated PNG</strong>, widely implemented for a decade but not part of the
    official specification until now</li><li><strong>Coding-Independent Code Points</strong>, which clearly identify the color space
    used by a graphic for improved rendering fidelity without blowing up the file size.
    This includes support for High Dynamic Range (HDR)
    color spaces such as BT.2100 HLG and PQ</li><li>Support for <strong>EXIF metadata</strong></li></ul><p>
  The PNG Working Group will continue to refine the PNG specification, including
   handling newly reported bugs,
  tracking implementations, and
  adding Web Platform Tests for the format.</p>
